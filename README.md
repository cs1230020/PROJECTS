# PROJECTS




• Matrix-Vector DSL Interpreter (Prof. Sanjiva Prasad) (March '25) : Designed a complete domain-specifc language for
matrix, vector and arithmetic operations in OCaml with type-checker and interpreter. Created control fow constructs (ifthen-else, for/while loops) and I/O operations for reading from fles and console. Developed extensive test suite
demonstrating complex algorithms like Gaussian elimination and matrix inversion, with robust error handling.
• Cache Coherence Simulator (Prof. Rijurekha Sen) (March '25 - April '25) : Developed a multiprocessor cache
coherence simulator in C++ modeling private L1 caches with MESI protocol implementation. Implemented full MESI state
machine handling all coherence transitions, bus snooping operations, and inter-cache communication via shared bus.
Created trace generator demonstrating false sharing scenarios and performed detailed analysis of results.
• Vim Spreadsheet(Prof. Abhilash Jindal) (January '25 - April '25) : Developed a feature-rich spreadsheet combining
Vim's modal editing efciency with comprehensive spreadsheet functionality in Rust and C language with a custom
evaluation engine of arithmetic operations with real-time updates. Implemented Vim-functionalities with Vim-style
navigation and visual range selection. Achieved 80% unit test coverage and zero Clippy warnings.
• Library Digitalization (Prof. Parag Singla) (October '24): Developed a digital library system to manage books
efciently by implementing word processing and search methods using custom designed HashMaps.
• Cargo Management using AVL trees(Prof. Parag Singla) (September '24) : Developed a project to optimize space
cargo management by implementing Compact Fit and Largest Fit algorithms for efcient bin packing.
• Treasure Quest: The Straw Hat Crew (Prof. Parag Singla) (October '24) : Implemented a scheduling system to
optimize treasure management among the Straw Hat pirates using a heap-based priority system. Designed and
implemented a min-heap to manage crewmates’ load efciently, with a focus on minimizing treasure processing time.
• Gate Packing (Prof. Preeti Ranjan Panda) (August '24) : Successfully developed a project to automatically generate a
compact physical layout of a gate-level circuit using Python and algorithms like First Fit Decreasing Height and Split Fit.
• Flight Planner using Dijkstra (Prof. Parag Singla) (November '24) : Developed a fight planner using Dijkstra's
algorithm to efciently fnd optimal fight routes based on diferent criteria like least price and least time.
• Probability (Prof. S. Dharmaraja) (September '24) : Developed and implemented Monte Carlo simulations in Python to
analyze and predict probabilities and expected outcomes of various chess strategies.
• Markov Chain and Transition Probabilities(Prof. S. Dharmaraja) (November '24) : Analyzed and modeled a
gambler’s betting strategy using a markov chain to determine the probability of winning or losing under diferent conditions.
• RISC-V Pipeline Processor Simulator (Prof. Rijurekha Sen) (February '25 - March '25) : Designed and implemented
a RISC-V pipeline processor simulator in C++ supporting 5-stage pipeline without forwarding and with data forwarding.
