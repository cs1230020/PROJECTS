# Projects

- **Matrix-Vector DSL Interpreter** (Prof. Sanjiva Prasad) *(March '25)*: Designed a complete domain-specific language for matrix, vector, and arithmetic operations in OCaml with type-checker and interpreter. Created control flow constructs (if-then-else, for/while loops) and I/O operations for reading from files and console. Developed extensive test suite demonstrating complex algorithms like Gaussian elimination and matrix inversion, with robust error handling.

- **Cache Coherence Simulator** (Prof. Rijurekha Sen) *(March '25 - April '25)*: Developed a multiprocessor cache coherence simulator in C++ modeling private L1 caches with MESI protocol implementation. Implemented full MESI state machine handling all coherence transitions, bus snooping operations, and inter-cache communication via shared bus. Created trace generator demonstrating false sharing scenarios and performed detailed analysis of results.

- **Vim Spreadsheet** (Prof. Abhilash Jindal) *(January '25 - April '25)*: Developed a feature-rich spreadsheet combining Vim's modal editing efficiency with comprehensive spreadsheet functionality in Rust and C language with a custom evaluation engine of arithmetic operations with real-time updates. Implemented Vim-functionalities with Vim-style navigation and visual range selection. Achieved 80% unit test coverage and zero Clippy warnings.

- **Library Digitalization** (Prof. Parag Singla) *(October '24)*: Developed a digital library system to manage books efficiently by implementing word processing and search methods using custom designed HashMaps.

- **Cargo Management using AVL Trees** (Prof. Parag Singla) *(September '24)*: Developed a project to optimize space cargo management by implementing Compact Fit and Largest Fit algorithms for efficient bin packing.

- **Treasure Quest: The Straw Hat Crew** (Prof. Parag Singla) *(October '24)*: Implemented a scheduling system to optimize treasure management among the Straw Hat pirates using a heap-based priority system. Designed and implemented a min-heap to manage crewmates’ load efficiently, with a focus on minimizing treasure processing time.

- **Gate Packing** (Prof. Preeti Ranjan Panda) *(August '24)*: Successfully developed a project to automatically generate a compact physical layout of a gate-level circuit using Python and algorithms like First Fit Decreasing Height and Split Fit.

- **Flight Planner using Dijkstra** (Prof. Parag Singla) *(November '24)*: Developed a flight planner using Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find optimal flight routes based on different criteria like least price and least time.

- **Probability** (Prof. S. Dharmaraja) *(September '24)*: Developed and implemented Monte Carlo simulations in Python to analyze and predict probabilities and expected outcomes of various chess strategies.

- **Markov Chain and Transition Probabilities** (Prof. S. Dharmaraja) *(November '24)*: Analyzed and modeled a gambler’s betting strategy using a Markov chain to determine the probability of winning or losing under different conditions.

- **RISC-V Pipeline Processor Simulator** (Prof. Rijurekha Sen) *(February '25 - March '25)*: Designed and implemented a RISC-V pipeline processor simulator in C++ supporting 5-stage pipeline without forwarding and with data forwarding.
